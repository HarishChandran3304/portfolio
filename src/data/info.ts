  about: `I am currently a Sophomore at Vellore Institute of Technology Chennai, India pursuing a B-Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in AI and Robotics.
    I am a tech enthusiast exploring the various fields of CS, trying to find my niche.
    I started my coding journey in the 12th grade and I have been enjoying it ever since.
    I love building things and enjoy optimizing the ins and outs of them even more.
    I started with Python and built anything and everything from web servers to desktop and mobile apps to automation scripts and gradually started branching out to difference languages like C, C++, Java, etc.
    Some of my favourite frameworks and tools to work with include Flask, FastAPI, MongoDB, FireBase, MySQL, Git, GitHub, WSL, Neovim, Postman, etc.
    I am currently exploring Web Dev, Compiler Design and Competetive Programming.
    In my free time, I like to play football, play the electric guitar and participate in CTFs.
